## Introduction

The Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns are a set of 23 software design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems in object-oriented software development. This repository aims to provide clear and concise examples of each design pattern implemented in various programming languages.

## Design Patterns

The repository covers three categories of design patterns:

### Creational Patterns

1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype

### Structural Patterns

1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns

1. Chain of Responsibility
2. Command
3. Interpreter
4. Iterator
5. Mediator
6. Memento
7. Observer
8. State
9. Strategy
10. Template Method
11. Visitor

Each design pattern is organized in its own Package Category 
``ex: src/BehaviourPatterns/memento``

## Languages

The examples are provided in the following programming languages:

- Java
